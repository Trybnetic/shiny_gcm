## Generalized Context Model of categorization
This repository contains a little shiny app to illustrate the Generalized Context Model of categorization. I made this app for the lecture "FS Bayesche Statistik". Feel free to fork this repository and to customize it for your purpose.

### Run the App
Simple type the following commands into your R REPL:
```R
library(shiny)
runGitHub("trybnetic/shiny_gcm")
```
**Please note:** You need to install the R-package `shiny`.
